In this project, I developed a Python web scraper using cloudscraper and BeautifulSoup to collect detailed product data, including names, prices, and unit prices, from the Japanese whisky category on The Whisky Exchange website. After scraping, I used pandas to organize the data into a DataFrame and export it as an Excel file. I then imported the Excel file into MySQL Workbench, where I performed the main data cleaning and transformation work. This included renaming columns, removing special characters, stripping out currency symbols, and standardizing the unit formats. Using SQL queries, I analyzed the dataset by sorting and ranking the products based on price to uncover meaningful insights into the Japanese whisky market. This project demonstrates my ability to build an end-to-end data pipeline, combining web scraping, Excel export, and SQL-based data cleaning and analysis.
